I've introduced designers to modular design, built deploy systems with back-end developers and been lead developer on several projects. 

As much as I enjoy a pretty design, I also know that's not enough to make a project successful. 

> Accessibility and usability are important aspects of every project, therefore I believe in a close collaboration between UX, designer and front-end.

Apart from being a front-end web developer I have also run a web and communications agency with clients such as Médecins Sans Frontières and Sweden for UNHCR. I have a university diploma in graphic design and web development and have several years of experience working as a consultant.

I want to work on projects that I can be proud of, be a part of amazing teams and develop my skill set. If you're interested in helping me make this happen, <a href="/#contact">let's get in touch</a>.
