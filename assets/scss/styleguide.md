# Introduction

This is a style guide for your website. Here are all the style elements that are developed, and they serves as a reference point for all those who in some way are working with the website. A style guide is a living documentation developed side by side with the website.

Purpose of the style guide:
* to document and get an overview of all components
* to create a consistent use of the style elements
* to encourage and facilitate code reuse

# For developers
Before continuing, you should have a general understanding for specificity, the [SCSS syntax](http://sass-lang.com/), and [KSS documentation](https://github.com/kneath/kss).

## Gulp

## Coding style
We are inspired by, and mostly following [Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es/) by [Hugo Giraudel](http://hugogiraudel.com/).

### Syntax and formatting

Generally, we want:

* two (2) spaces indents, no tabs;
* ideally, 80-characters wide lines;
* properly written multi-line CSS rules;
* meaningful use of whitespace;
* strings and urls should always be wrapped with single quotes.

### Naming conventions
We use [BEVM](http://webuild.envato.com/blog/chainable-bem-modifiers/), an extension of [BEM](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) with [namespaces](http://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/) and [BEMIT](http://csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/) to make the css both readable and modular.

#### BEVM
Example of BEVM:

    .block {}
    .block__element {}
    .block--variant {}
    .block__element--variant {}
    .block--variant.-modifier {}

#### Namespaces
We use the following namespaces:

* Object (o-)
* Component (c-)
* Utility, also known as helper (u-)
* Hack (_)
* JavaScript (js-)

[More detailed introduction to these namespaces.](http://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/#the-namespaces)

#### BEVM & namespaces
Example of BEVM with namespaces:

    .c-block {}
    .c-block.-modifier {}
    .c-block__element {}
    .c-block--variant {}
    .c-block__element--variant {}
    .c-block--variant.-modifier {}
    .c-block--variant.is-open {}
    .c-block.js-accordion {}

#### Responsive Suffixes
Example of BEVM with namespaces and responsive suffixes:

    .o-object\@xlarge {}

#### Single class vs multiple classes
We use single classes as 'variations' and multiple classes as 'chainable modifiers'. We never use both 'block'-class and 'variant'-classes on the same element. If it has a variation, use only that class.

### Architecture
The CSS architecture is based on [Inverted Triangle CSS](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-scale-web-projects-new-css-architecture-itcss-41514731)
by [Harry Roberts](https://twitter.com/csswizardry/).
It is layer-based architecture that goes from generic css to explicit,
low specificity to high specificity.

#### Settings
This holds all global settings that need to be accessed from anywhere.
Examples of settings: font-families, color palettes, configurations.

#### Tools
Tools are globally available tools like mixins and functions.
Tools that does not need accessing globally belongs in
the partial to which it relates.
Examples of tools: font-sizing mixins, breakpoint mixins.

#### Generic
This is the first layer that actually produces css.
Here you can find very high-level, far reaching styles.
This layer is rarely modified and you' won't find any classes here.
Examples: resets, sanitize.

#### Elements
These are bare, unclassed HTML elements,
slightly more specific than the generic layer.
What does a blockquote look like without classes?
This is the last layer you'll find bare, element-based selectors.
Examples: h1, blockquote, ul, image.

#### Objects
This is the first layer in which we find class-based selectors.
These are concerned with styling non-cosmetic design patterns, or ‘objects’.
Examples: wrappers, grids.
**Prefixed with o-**

#### Components
This layers holds the cosmetic design patterns. This is where most of the
work will happen.
Examples: icons, menus, pagination.
**Prefixed with c-**

#### Trumps
This layers beats all other layers.
It contains utility and helper classes, hacks and overrides.
**Prefixed with u-**

### Commenting
We use [KSS](https://github.com/kneath/kss) for commenting css, and generating documentation.

#### SassDoc
We use [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com/) for commenting and generating sass-specific documentation, like mixins and variables. These are not included here. **The SassDoc comments are inline with three slashes (///)**.

Example:

    /// Font size in em.
    /// @param {Number} $target-px - The font-size in pixels you want
    /// @param {Number} $context [$root-font-size] - The font-size of the context you are in
    @function pxtoem($target-px, $context: $root-font-size) {
      @return $target-px / $context * 1em;
    }
